## Overview

This application is a machine-learning-based cardiac risk assessment tool designed to assist clinicians and health-conscious individuals in identifying early warning signs from standard biomarker data. The model takes patient-reported and clinically measured parameters as input and returns a probabilistic risk score, enabling data-informed decision-making before symptoms become critical.

Built on Streamlit for rapid deployment, the application wraps a trained binary classifier — trained on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset — inside a clean, accessible UI. The prediction is accompanied by a SHAP explanation plot that breaks down each feature's contribution to the risk score, ensuring that the model's reasoning is visible and auditable rather than a black box.

The project also includes a full model comparison module where multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, KNN) are evaluated side-by-side on the same test partition, with accuracy, AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score reported. This allows the deployment model to be chosen based on the performance metric most appropriate to the clinical context — favouring recall over precision in high-stakes screening scenarios.

## Motivation

Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of preventable mortality worldwide. Access to specialist-level screening is unevenly distributed, particularly in lower-resource healthcare settings. This project was motivated by the question: can a well-calibrated ML model, operating on data available in a standard clinical visit, provide a reliable first-line risk signal that guides further investigation? The answer, on benchmark datasets, is yes.

The pipeline object (scaler + model) is serialised with joblib and loaded at app startup. Threshold for risk categorisation (default 0.5) is configurable in the sidebar.

## Features

### Biomarker Input Interface
Validated input widgets for all clinical features — age, sex, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, max heart rate, and chest pain type.

### Risk Probability Output
The model outputs a continuous probability score between 0 and 1, displayed as a colour-coded gauge (green/amber/red) with a plain-language risk category interpretation.

### SHAP Feature Attribution
A SHAP waterfall chart accompanies every prediction, showing which biomarkers pushed the risk score up or down and by how much — critical for clinical interpretability.

### Multi-Model Evaluation Panel
Compare Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and KNN classifiers on accuracy, AUC-ROC, F1, precision, and recall using a shared train/test split.

### ROC Curve Visualisation
Interactive ROC curves for all models on a single plot, enabling threshold selection based on the clinical sensitivity/specificity trade-off.

### Confusion Matrix Display
Normalised confusion matrix heatmap for the selected deployment model, with TP/TN/FP/FN counts and derived metrics.

### Batch CSV Screening
Upload a CSV of multiple patient records for batch risk scoring, with a downloadable output table including risk scores and categories.

### Clinical Caveat Footer
Every prediction page includes a mandatory disclaimer reminding users that this tool is a decision-support aid and does not replace clinical diagnosis.
